# CLOUDFLARE_ADMIN_EMAIL is the account email associated with your Cloudflare
# tenant. This is often required when authenticating API requests. Use the
# primary email of the account owner or a delegated admin account. Avoid using
# personal addresses in shared environments.
CLOUDFLARE_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com

# CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN is a Cloudflare API token with permissions sufficient
# for your automation tasks. Limit its scope to only what is necessary, such
# as DNS or zone settings, instead of granting full account access. Always
# treat this token as a secret and rotate it regularly.
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=changeme

# DOMAIN defines the base domain used by your deployment. For example, if
# DOMAIN=zitadel.io, services can resolve to subdomains like app.zitadel.io
# or api.zitadel.io. Adjust this to match the actual domain for your setup.
DOMAIN=example.com

# ZITADEL_MASTERKEY is the 32-character key used to encrypt sensitive data
# within Zitadel. Due to Zitadel limitations, THIS KEY CANNOT BE ROTATED
# once set. Changing it after deployment will cause data loss and make
# the instance unusable. Always generate a secure, random value before
# the first deployment and store it in a secret manager. Treat this key
# with the highest level of confidentiality.
ZITADEL_MASTERKEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
