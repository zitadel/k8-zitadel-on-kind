# Zitadel Local Development Setup

This project demonstrates how to run Zitadel locally with a complete observability stack - showing you all the bells and whistles of a modern identity platform deployment. It's a comprehensive example setup for developers who want to see how Zitadel integrates with monitoring, logging, and tracing systems in a realistic Kubernetes environment.

The setup includes everything you'd expect in a production Zitadel deployment: automatic TLS certificates, comprehensive telemetry collection, distributed tracing, structured logging, and metrics dashboards. While this configuration prioritizes ease of setup over production security, it provides a complete picture of how all the pieces fit together.

The stack demonstrates:
- Zitadel's OpenTelemetry tracing integration
- Log aggregation from Kubernetes applications
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Automatic certificate management
- Service mesh communication patterns
- Database integration and monitoring

This is perfect for developers evaluating Zitadel, learning about observability patterns, or building applications that need to integrate with a fully-instrumented identity provider.

### Architecture

This stack uses carefully selected tools that work together to provide a complete observability experience with minimal operational overhead:

**OpenObserve** replaces the traditional three-pillar approach (Prometheus + Jaeger + ELK stack) with a single unified backend. Unlike managing separate systems for metrics, traces, and logs, OpenObserve ingests all telemetry types through standard protocols (OTLP, Prometheus Remote Write, structured JSON). This dramatically reduces the complexity of running multiple databases, managing different query languages, and correlating data across systems. For a Zitadel demo environment, this means you get comprehensive observability without the operational burden of a full Grafana + Prometheus + Jaeger setup.

**Traefik** handles ingress and automatic certificate management through its native ACME integration. Unlike nginx-ingress which requires separate cert-manager installations, Traefik includes built-in Let's Encrypt support with DNS-01 challenges. This means wildcard certificates and automatic renewal work out of the box with just Cloudflare API tokens. For local development with real domains, this eliminates the complexity of certificate provisioning while providing production-like TLS behavior.

**Vector** serves as the log collection agent because it excels at parsing and normalizing diverse log formats from Kubernetes workloads. While alternatives like Fluent Bit focus on lightweight forwarding, Vector includes powerful transformation capabilities that clean up application logs before they reach OpenObserve. The configuration includes parsers for Zitadel, etcd, Prometheus, and other common Kubernetes components, ensuring structured, searchable logs rather than raw text dumps.

This architecture provides a production-representative observability stack while keeping the deployment simple enough for local development and learning.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (tested with Docker Desktop)
- Helmfile CLI installed
- kubectl configured for your cluster
- A domain managed by Cloudflare (e.g., `test.io`, `example.com`)
- Cloudflare API tokens with appropriate permissions:
	- Zone API token with `Zone:Read` permissions for your domain
	- DNS API token with `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Edit` permissions for your domain

  For creating these tokens, follow the [Cloudflare API Token documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) to create custom tokens with the specific permissions listed above for your domain's zone.

### Configuration

Copy the example environment file and update it with your specific values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration details.

### Usage

#### Deploy the Stack
```bash
source .env
make deploy
```

#### Available Make Commands

**`make deploy`**
Deploys the entire stack in dependency-aware order. First injects the Cloudflare API token into the 'prepare' release, then syncs all other releases using the dependency graph defined in helmfile.yaml.

**`make destroy`**
Gracefully uninstalls all Helm releases while preserving namespaces and Persistent Volume Claims. Uses reverse dependency order to safely tear down the stack.

**`make nuke`**
Complete destructive reset - deletes all namespaces (traefik-system, monitoring, zitadel, observability) and their associated PVCs, then redeploys the entire stack. Use with caution as this removes all data.

**`make status`** (if available)
Shows the status of all releases in the helmfile.
## Important Notes

### Host Header Requirement

The ingresses are configured for `Host: localhost`. Access must be via:

- `http://localhost` (works automatically)
- NOT `http://172.20.0.5` (will timeout due to host header mismatch)

### Login Process

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost/ui/console?login_hint=zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`
2. Enter password: `Password1!`
3. Access the Zitadel management console

### Service Access (for debugging)

```bash
# Direct access to Zitadel
kubectl port-forward -n zitadel svc/zitadel 8080:8080
# Visit: http://localhost:8080

# Direct access to Login service
kubectl port-forward -n zitadel svc/zitadel-login 3000:3000
# Visit: http://localhost:3000

# Traefik dashboard
kubectl port-forward -n traefik-system svc/traefik 8081:8080
# Visit: http://localhost:8081/dashboard/
```



## Configuration Details

### Traefik Configuration

- Service type: LoadBalancer (works with Docker Desktop)
- RBAC enabled for cross-namespace access
- Default ingress class enabled

### Zitadel Configuration

- External domain: `localhost`
- External port: 80
- TLS disabled (for local development)
- PostgreSQL backend with insecure connection
- FirstInstance admin user auto-created

### PostgreSQL Configuration

- Trust authentication enabled (`host all all all trust`)
- Dedicated database and user for Zitadel
- Persistent storage via StatefulSet

## Security Notes

⚠️ **This configuration is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY**

- PostgreSQL uses trust authentication
- TLS is disabled
- Default passwords are used
- No network policies or security restrictions

For production deployment, enable TLS, use proper authentication, and follow security best practices.

## Clean Up

```bash
# Remove all resources
pulumi destroy --yes

# Verify cleanup
kubectl get all -n zitadel
kubectl get all -n traefik-system
```


# Caveats

#### Not many metrics

Zitadel does not expose any custom metrics. This can be checked the following command

```
kubectl run curl-test --rm -i --tty --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl -n zitadel -- curl -s http://zitadel:8080/debug/metrics | grep "^# HELP" | awk '{print $3}' | sort
```

```

#### ETCD logs messy logs

https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13295

Once docker desktop switches to 3.6 then we can ditcha that grok hell

➜ kubectl describe pod etcd-desktop-control-plane -n kube-system | grep Image:

    Image:         registry.k8s.io/etcd:3.5.21-0

The current logs from etcd are like

```
{"level":"info","ts":"2025-09-08T06:09:09.866107Z","caller":"etcdserver/server.go:2569","msg":"compacted Raft logs","compact-index":475052}
```


#### Traefik does not sent OTLP traces in some versions
